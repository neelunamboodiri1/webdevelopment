<p>After his Ph.D. in 1972 and moving to College Station Texas, my grandfather was a Staff Research Scientist at the Cyclotron Institute. He became a key member of a research team with collaborators across Europe and Asia. Muthassen spent 11 very productive years at A&M.  From 1983, he has been in government service at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. At age 82, he is still working 1-2 days a week and every year, though he says he will retire next year. He is also a published poet.</p>
